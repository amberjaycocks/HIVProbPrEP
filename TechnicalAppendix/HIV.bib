  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The potential impact of pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis
	(PrEP) on heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 infection in resource-limited
	settings is uncertain. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: A deterministic
	mathematical model was used to simulate the effects of antiretroviral
	PrEP on an HIV-1 epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa under different scenarios
	(optimistic, neutral and pessimistic) both with and without sexual
	disinhibition. Sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate the effect
	of uncertainty in input parameters on model output and included calculation
	of partial rank correlations and standardized rank regressions. In
	the scenario without sexual disinhibition after PrEP initiation,
	key parameters influencing infections prevented were effectiveness
	of PrEP (partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) = 0.94), PrEP
	discontinuation rate (PRCC = -0.94), level of coverage (PRCC = 0.92),
	and time to achieve target coverage (PRCC = -0.82). In the scenario
	with sexual disinhibition, PrEP effectiveness and the extent of sexual
	disinhibition had the greatest impact on prevention. An optimistic
	scenario of PrEP with 90\% effectiveness and 75\% coverage of the
	general population predicted a 74\% decline in cumulative HIV-1 infections
	after 10 years, and a 28.8\% decline with PrEP targeted to the highest
	risk groups (16\% of the population). Even with a 100\% increase
	in at-risk behavior from sexual disinhibition, a beneficial effect
	(23.4\%-62.7\% decrease in infections) was seen with 90\% effective
	PrEP across a broad range of coverage (25\%-75\%). Similar disinhibition
	led to a rise in infections with lower effectiveness of PrEP (< or
	= 50\%). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Mathematical modeling supports
	the potential public health benefit of PrEP. Approximately 2.7 to
	3.2 million new HIV-1 infections could be averted in southern sub-Saharan
	Africa over 10 years by targeting PrEP (having 90\% effectiveness)
	to those at highest behavioral risk and by preventing sexual disinhibition.
	This benefit could be lost, however, by sexual disinhibition and
	by high PrEP discontinuation, especially with lower PrEP effectiveness
	(< or = 50\%).},

  abstract = {The U.S. Government has pledged to spend $15 billion in Africa and
	the Caribbean on AIDS. A central focus of this plan is to provide
	antiretroviral treatment (ART) to millions. Here, we evaluate whether
	the plan to rollout ART in Africa is likely to generate an epidemic
	of drug-resistant strains of HIV. We review what has occurred as
	a result of high usage of ART in developed countries in terms of
	changes in risky behavior, and the emergence and transmission of
	drug-resistant HIV. We also review how mathematical models have been
	used to predict the evolution of drug-resistant HIV epidemics. We
	then show how models can be used to predict the likely impact of
	the ART rollout on the evolution of drug-resistant HIV in Africa.
	At currently planned levels of treatment coverage, we predict that
	(over the next decade) in Africa: (i) the impact of ART on reducing
	HIV transmission (and prevalence) is likely to be undetectable (unless
	accompanied by substantial changes in behavior), (ii) the transmission
	rate of drug-resistant HIV will be below the WHO surveillance threshold
	of 5\%, and (ii) the majority of cases of drug-resistant HIV that
	will occur will be due to acquired (and not transmitted) resistance.
	For the next decade, large-scale surveillance for detecting transmitted
	resistance in Africa is unnecessary. Instead, we recommend that patients
	should be closely monitored for acquired resistance, and sentinel
	surveillance (in a few urban centers) should be used to monitor transmitted

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Currently, antiviral resistance is a major public
	health concern. Here, we review how mathematical models have been
	used to provide insights into the emerging threat of antiviral resistance.
	We focus mainly on the problem of drug resistance to HIV. RECENT
	FINDINGS: We review how antiviral models of HIV have been used: (1)
	to understand the evolution of an epidemic of drug-resistant HIV,
	(2) to predict the incidence and prevalence of drug-resistant HIV,
	(3) to conduct biological 'cost-benefit' analyses, and(4) to make
	public health policy recommendations. We also briefly discuss antiviral
	resistance for HSV-2 and influenza. Recent studies indicate that
	for HSV-2 and influenza drug resistance is not likely to become a
	major public health problem. However, for HIV the situation is very
	different. Results from several studies predict that a high prevalence
	of drug-resistant HIV will be an inevitable consequence of more widespread
	usage of antiretroviral therapies (ART). However more widespread
	usage of ART will save a substantial number of lives, and could even
	result in epidemic eradication. SUMMARY: Models have been used in
	many ways to provide insight into the emerging threat of antiviral
	resistance, particularly for HIV. At this stage in the HIV epidemic
	the most important future use of models may be that they will force
	the goals of public health policies to be clearly defined. Once goals
	have been defined it can then be decided whether a high prevalence
	of drug-resistant HIV is a threat or simply a justified means to
	an end.},

  abstract = {Recently, the number of European and North American heterosexually
	transmitted AIDS cases has begun to increase. It appears that injecting
	drug users may be acting as an important infection source for heterosexual
	transmission, and that the HIV-1 epidemic may be slowly diffusing
	out into the general population. Therefore, the question arises,
	as to whether there will be an extensive heterosexually transmitted
	epidemic in Europe or North America. The possibility of such an epidemic
	occurring depends upon three factors: sexual mixing patterns, the
	prevalence and the distribution of specific risk factors, and changes
	in risk behaviours. To assess the potential for an extensive sustained
	heterosexually transmitted epidemic it is necessary to estimate these
	three factors by conducting large-scale linked behavioural and seroprevalence
	surveys. Unfortunately, such surveys have yet to be conducted in
	any country. However, a limited amount of sexual behaviour data are
	available from three small studies that have been conducted in the
	U.K. Although each of the studies suffers from methodological imperfections,
	together they may be used as the basis for a preliminary assessment
	of the potential effects of heterosexual transmission in the U.K.
	In this paper I discuss the results from an exploratory analysis
	of these data; the results are organized into five sections: (i)
	assessment of the prevalence and distribution of specific risk behaviours;
	(ii) determination of covariates of risk behaviours (and hence characterization
	of the subgroups that may be at risk); (iii) assessment of age-dependent
	sexual mixing patterns; (iv) assessment of sexual behaviour changes;
	and (v) calculation of epidemiological parameters. The validity and
	the reliability of the data from the three studies are assessed.
	The analysis suggests that it is possible that a heterosexually transmitted
	HIV-1 epidemic could occur in the U.K. Hence, it is essential to
	conduct longitudinal surveys that collect linked seroprevalence and
	behavioural data.},

	To further characterize the effect of nucleoside analogue resistance
	mutations on the efficiency and kinetics of HIV-1 DNA synthesis and
	to evaluate the impact of the depletion of deoxynucleoside triphosphates
	(dNTP) on this process, DNA synthesis was evaluated by allowing DNA
	synthesis to proceed with natural HIV-1 templates and primers, either

	and quantifying the products by real-time PCR. Three recombinant

	M184V, a clone expressing mutations M41L plus T215Y (M41L+T215Y),
	and clinical isolate BV34 (carrying seven resistance mutations).
	Following infection of P4 cells, the BV34 mutant, but not viruses
	expressing the M184V mutation or M41L+T215Y, exhibited a defect in
	DNA synthesis. Importantly, however, for mutants carrying the M184V
	mutation or M41L+T215Y mutations, a defect could be detected by using
	target cells in which dATP pools had been reduced by pretreatment

	instigated extensive researches on the mechanisms behind the transmission
	dynamics of TB epidemics. This article provides a detailed review
	of the work on the dynamics and control of TB. The earliest mathematical
	models describing the TB dynamics appeared in the 1960s and focused
	on the prediction and control strategies using simulation approaches.
	Most recently developed models not only pay attention to simulations
	but also take care of dynamical analysis using modern knowledge of
	dynamical systems. Questions addressed by these models mainly concentrate
	on TB control strategies, optimal vaccination policies, approaches
	toward the elimination of TB in the U.S.A., TB co-infection with
	HIV/AIDS, drug-resistant TB, responses of the immune system, impacts
	of demography, the role of public transportation systems, and the
	impact of contact patterns. Model formulations involve a variety
	of mathematical areas, such as ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations)
	(both autonomous and non-autonomous systems), PDEs (Partial Differential
	Equations), system of difference equations, system of integro-differential
	equations, Markov chain model, and simulation models.},

	ART who received antiretroviral treatment in Khayelitsha, from May
	2001 to the end of 2002. Patients were followed until their most
	recent visit before 31 July 2003. METHODS: Plasma viral load was

	and CD4 cell counts 6-monthly. Kaplan-Meier estimates were determined
	for the cumulative proportions of patients surviving, and patients

	287 patients were initiated on triple therapy. The probability of
	survival was 86.3\% at 24 months. The median CD4 cell count gain
	was 288 cells/microliters at 24 months. Viral load was less than

	with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts above 200 cells per cubic millimeter

	kilogram of body weight given intravenously over one hour, then 1
	mg per kilogram per hour until delivery), and zidovudine for the
	newborn (2 mg per kilogram orally every six hours for six weeks).
	Infants with at least one positive HIV culture of peripheral-blood
	mononuclear cells were classified as HIV-infected.From April 1991
	through December 20, 1993, the cutoff date for the first interim
	analysis of efficacy, 477 pregnant women were enrolled; during the
	study period, 409 gave birth to 415 live-born infants. HIV-infection

	with the OVID search engine. The search covered articles from January
	1987 to September 1998 and yielded 2101 articles. Methods used to
	uncover articles which might have been missed included searching
	for related articles by author, and combing literature reviews. In
	addition, all abstracts under the category "sexually transmitted
	diseases" from the XI and XII International Conferences on AIDS (Vancouver
	1996 and Geneva 1998) and other relevant scientific meetings were
	reviewed. Efforts were made to locate journal articles which resulted
	from the research reported in the identified abstracts. All original
	journal articles and abstracts which met one of the following criteria
	were included: (1) studies of the biological plausibility or mechanism
	of facilitation of HIV infectiousness or susceptibility by STDs,
	(2) prospective cohort studies (longitudinal or nested case-control)
	which estimate the risk of HIV infection associated with specific
	STDs or STD syndromes, or (3) intervention studies which quantitate
	the effect which STD treatment can have on HIV incidence.Strong evidence
	indicates that both ulcerative and non-ulcerative STDs promote HIV
	transmission by augmenting HIV infectiousness and HIV susceptibility
	via a variety of biological mechanisms. These effects are reflected
	in the risk estimates found in numerous prospective studies from
	four continents which range from 2.0 to 23.5, with most clustering
	between 2 and 5. The relative importance of ulcerative and non-ulcerative
	STDs appears to be complex. Owing to the greater frequency of non-ulcerative
	STDs in many populations, these infections may be responsible for
	more HIV transmission than genital ulcers. However, the limited reciprocal
	impact of HIV infection on non-ulcerative STDs and the evidence that
	non-ulcerative STDs may increase risk primarily for the receptive
	partner (rather than bidirectionally) may modulate the impact of
	these diseases. The results of two community level randomised, controlled
	intervention trials conducted in Africa suggest that timely provision
	of STD services can substantially reduce HIV incidence, but raise
	additional questions about the optimal way to target and implement
	these services to achieve the greatest effect on HIV transmission.Available
	data leave little doubt that other STDs facilitate HIV transmission
	through direct, biological mechanisms and that early STD treatment
	should be part of a high quality, comprehensive HIV prevention strategy.
	Policy makers, HIV prevention programme managers, and providers should
	focus initial implementation efforts on three key areas: (i) improving
	access to and quality of STD clinical services; (ii) promoting early
	and effective STD related healthcare behaviours; and (iii) establishing
	surveillance systems to monitor STD and HIV trends and their interrelations.},

	before exposure to HIV. Clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of
	daily treatment with the reverse transcriptase inhibitors tenofovir

	mucosal transmission. We tested this hypothesis by intermittently
	giving prophylactic Truvada to macaque monkeys and then exposing
	them rectally to simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) once
	a week for 14 weeks. A simple regimen with an oral dose of Truvada
	given 1, 3, or 7 days before exposure followed by a second dose 2
	hours after exposure was as protective as daily drug administration,
	possibly because of the long intracellular persistence of the drugs.
	In addition, a two-dose regimen initiated 2 hours before or after
	virus exposure was effective, and full protection was obtained by
	doubling the Truvada concentration in both doses. We saw no protection
	if the first dose was delayed until 24 hours after exposure, underscoring
	the importance of blocking initial replication in the mucosa. Our
	results show that intermittent prophylactic treatment with an antiviral
	drug can be highly effective in preventing SHIV infection, with a
	wide window of protection. They strengthen the possibility of developing
	feasible, cost-effective strategies to prevent HIV transmission in

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the absence of an effective vaccine, HIV continues
	to spread globally, emphasizing the need for novel strategies to
	limit its transmission. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with antiretroviral
	drugs could prove to be an effective intervention strategy if highly
	efficacious and cost-effective PrEP modalities are identified. We
	evaluated daily and intermittent PrEP regimens of increasing antiviral
	activity in a macaque model that closely resembles human transmission.
	METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a repeat-exposure macaque model with
	14 weekly rectal virus challenges. Three drug treatments were given
	once daily, each to a different group of six rhesus macaques. Group
	1 was treated subcutaneously with a human-equivalent dose of emtricitabine
	(FTC), group 2 received orally the human-equivalent dosing of both
	FTC and tenofovir-disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and group 3 received
	subcutaneously a similar dosing of FTC and a higher dose of tenofovir.
	A fourth group of six rhesus macaques (group 4) received intermittently
	a PrEP regimen similar to group 3 only 2 h before and 24 h after
	each weekly virus challenge. Results were compared to 18 control
	macaques that did not receive any drug treatment. The risk of infection
	in macaques treated in groups 1 and 2 was 3.8- and 7.8-fold lower
	than in untreated macaques (p = 0.02 and p = 0.008, respectively).
	All six macaques in group 3 were protected. Breakthrough infections
	had blunted acute viremias; drug resistance was seen in two of six
	animals. All six animals in group 4 that received intermittent PrEP
	were protected. CONCLUSIONS: This model suggests that single drugs
	for daily PrEP can be protective but a combination of antiretroviral
	drugs may be required to increase the level of protection. Short
	but potent intermittent PrEP can provide protection comparable to
	that of daily PrEP in this SHIV/macaque model. These findings support
	PrEP trials for HIV prevention in humans and identify promising PrEP
	modalities.},

	model of the spread and demographic impact of HIV in heterosexual
	communities in developing countries. The model extends previous work
	in this area by the representation of patterns of mixing between
	and within different age and sexual activity classes in a two sex
	structure. Summary parameters are derived to represent different
	mixing patterns, ranging from assortative via random to disassortative,
	as are methods to ensure that particular mixing patterns between
	different age and sexual classes (stratified on the basis of rates
	of sexual partner change) meet constraints that balance the supply
	and demand for sexual partners as AIDS induced mortality influences
	the demographic structure of a population. Analyses of model behaviour
	rely on numerical methods due to the complexity of the mathematical
	framework, and sensitivity analyses are conducted to assess the significance
	of different assumptions and different parameter assignments. Simulated
	patterns of HIV spread across the two sexes and various age classes
	are compared with observed patterns in Uganda. The principle conclusion
	of the study is that the pattern of mixing between age and sexual
	activity classes, combined with the assumptions made to balance supply
	and demand between the sexes have a very major influence on the predicted
	pattern of HIV spread and the demographic impact of AIDS. The paper

	METHODS: HIV acquisition was determined in a cohort of 5507 HIV-negative
	Ugandan men, and in 187 HIV-negative men in discordant relationships.
	Transmission was determined in 223 HIV-positive men with HIV-negative
	partners. HIV incidence per 100 person years (py) and adjusted rate
	ratios (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by
	Poisson regression. HIV-1 serum viral load was determined for the
	seropositive partners in HIV-discordant couples. RESULTS: The prevalence
	of circumcision was 16.5\% for all men; 99.1\% in Muslims and 3.7\%
	in non-Muslims. Circumcision was significantly associated with reduced
	HIV acquisition in the cohort as a whole (RR 0.53, CI 0.33-0.87),
	but not among non-Muslim men. Prepubertal circumcision significantly
	reduced HIV acquisition (RR 0.49, CI 0.26-0.82), but postpubertal
	circumcision did not. In discordant couples with HIV-negative men,
	no serconversions occurred in 50 circumcised men, whereas HIV acquisition
	was 16.7 per 100 py in uncircumcised men (P = 0.004). In couples
	with HIV-positive men, HIV transmission was significantly reduced
	in circumcised men with HIV viral loads less than 50000 copies/ml
	(P = 0.02). INTERPRETATION: Prepubertal circumcision may reduce male
	HIV acquisition in a general population, but the protective effects
	are confounded by cultural and behavioral factors in Muslims. In
	discordant couples, circumcision reduces HIV acquisition and transmission.
	The assessment of circumcision for HIV prevention is complex and

	Adjusted rate ratios of transmission per coital act were estimated
	by Poisson regression. Probabilities of transmission per act were
	estimated by log-log binomial regression for quartiles of age and
	HIV-1 viral load, and for symptoms or diagnoses of sexually transmitted
	diseases (STDs) in the HIV-1-infected partners. RESULTS: The mean
	frequency of intercourse was 8.9 per month, which declined with age
	and HIV-1 viral load. Members of couples reported similar frequencies
	of intercourse. The overall unadjusted probability of HIV-1 transmission
	per coital act was 0.0011 (95\% CI 0.0008-0.0015). Transmission probabilities
	increased from 0.0001 per act at viral loads of less than 1700 copies/mL

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: HIV-1 prevalence typically rises more rapidly at young
	ages in women than in men in sub-Saharan Africa. Greater susceptibility
	to infection on exposure in women is believed to be a contributory
	factor as is greater exposure to previously infected sexual partners
	of the opposite sex. We investigated the latter hypothesis using
	data from a field study in rural Manicaland, Zimbabwe. METHODS: Quantitative
	data on onset and degree of sexual activity, numbers of partners,
	concurrent partnerships, condom use, and partner characteristics
	were used in conjunction with epidemiological data on age and sex
	specific prevalence of HIV infection to do statistical analyses of
	association between key variables. Mathematical models and qualitative
	data were used to aid analysis and interpretation. FINDINGS: Older
	age of sexual partner was associated with increased risk of HIV-1
	infection in men (odds ratio 1.13 [95\% CI 1.02-1.25]) and women
	(1.04 [1.01-1.07]). Young women form partnerships with men 5-10 years
	older than themselves, whereas young men have relationships with
	women of a similar age or slightly younger. Greater number of lifetime
	partners is also associated with increased risk of HIV (1.03 [1.00-1.05]).
	Young men report more partners than do women but infrequent coital
	acts and greater use of condoms. These behaviour patterns are underpinned
	by cultural factors including the expectation that women should marry
	earlier than men. A strong gender effect remains after factors that
	affect exposure to infected partners are controlled for (6.04 [1.49-24.47]).
	INTERPRETATION: The substantial age difference between female and
	male sexual partners in Manicaland is the major behavioural determinant
	of the more rapid rise in HIV prevalence in young women than in men.
	Theoretical studies have suggested that this difference is an important
	determinant of observed epidemiological patterns but the study reported
	in this paper provides clear empirical evidence of association.},

	We investigated whether OVCs have heightened risks of adverse reproductive

	factors were collected for OVCs and non-OVCs in a population survey
	of 1523 teenage children in eastern Zimbabwe between July 2001 and
	March 2003. Multivariate logistic regression was used to test for
	statistical association between OVC status, adverse reproductive

	years, OVCs had higher HIV prevalence than non-OVCs (3.2\% versus
	0.0\%; p = 0.002) and more common experience of STI symptoms (5.9\%

	teenage pregnancy (8.3\% versus 1.9\%; 4.25, 1.58-11.42). OVCs (overall),
	maternal orphans and young women with an infected parent were more
	likely to have received no secondary school education and to have
	started sex and married, which, in turn, were associated with poor
	reproductive health. Amongst men aged 17-18 years, OVC status was
	not associated with HIV infection (0.5\% versus 0.0\%; p = 1.000)
	or STI symptoms (2.7\% versus 1.6\%; p = 0.529). No association was
	found between history of medical injections and HIV risk amongst

	to maternal orphanhood and parental HIV. Many of these could be averted
	through further female secondary school education. Predicted substantial

	If daily preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV is found to be efficacious
	and has as few physical side effects as TDF, acceptability of this

	of any new HIV-prevention measure, such as PrEP, is the potential
	for risk disinhibition or sexual risk compensation. The oral tenofovir
	HIV prevention trial has been the subject of international discussion
	in this regard. METHODS:: This article maps the changes in sexual
	risk behavior among women participating in the oral tenofovir HIV
	prevention trial in Ghana. Content-driven, thematic analysis was
	carried out on qualitative data obtained from in-depth interviews
	with study participants. Growth curve analysis was the primary method
	used to document trends over time in self-reported sexual behavior
	collected monthly. RESULTS:: Overall, the study found that sexual
	risk behavior did not increase during the trial. Number of sexual
	partners and rate of unprotected sex acts decreased across the 12-month
	period of study enrollment. Certain subgroups of women, however,
	exhibited different growth curves. Data indicate that the HIV prevention
	counseling associated with the trial was effective. CONCLUSIONS::
	Counseling during the trial was effective. Different types of counseling
	and messaging may be needed for different subgroups within a population.
	These findings also have implications for required sample sizes for
	future HIV prevention trials where seroconversion is the main outcome.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United
	States has not been directly measured. New assays that differentiate
	recent vs long-standing HIV infections allow improved estimation
	of HIV incidence. OBJECTIVE: To estimate HIV incidence in the United
	States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Remnant diagnostic serum specimens
	from patients 13 years or older and newly diagnosed with HIV during
	2006 in 22 states were tested with the BED HIV-1 capture enzyme immunoassay
	to classify infections as recent or long-standing. Information on
	HIV cases was reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
	through June 2007. Incidence of HIV in the 22 states during 2006
	was estimated using a statistical approach with adjustment for testing
	frequency and extrapolated to the United States. Results were corroborated
	with back-calculation of HIV incidence for 1977-2006 based on HIV
	diagnoses from 40 states and AIDS incidence from 50 states and the
	District of Columbia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Estimated HIV incidence.
	RESULTS: An estimated 39,400 persons were diagnosed with HIV in 2006
	in the 22 states. Of 6864 diagnostic specimens tested using the BED
	assay, 2133 (31\%) were classified as recent infections. Based on
	extrapolations from these data, the estimated number of new infections
	for the United States in 2006 was 56,300 (95\% confidence interval
	[CI], 48,200-64,500); the estimated incidence rate was 22.8 per 100,000
	population (95\% CI, 19.5-26.1). Forty-five percent of infections
	were among black individuals and 53\% among men who have sex with
	men. The back-calculation (n = 1.230 million HIV/AIDS cases reported
	by the end of 2006) yielded an estimate of 55,400 (95\% CI, 50,000-60,800)
	new infections per year for 2003-2006 and indicated that HIV incidence
	increased in the mid-1990s, then slightly declined after 1999 and
	has been stable thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the
	first direct estimates of HIV incidence in the United States using
	laboratory technologies previously implemented only in clinic-based
	settings. New HIV infections in the United States remain concentrated
	among men who have sex with men and among black individuals.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: The availability of new antiretroviral drugs and formulations,
	including drugs in new classes, and recent data on treatment choices
	for antiretroviral-naive and -experienced patients warrant an update
	of the International AIDS Society-USA guidelines for the use of antiretroviral
	therapy in adult human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. OBJECTIVES:
	To summarize new data in the field and to provide current recommendations
	for the antiretroviral management and laboratory monitoring of HIV
	infection. This report provides guidelines in key areas of antiretroviral
	management: when to initiate therapy, choice of initial regimens,
	patient monitoring, when to change therapy, and how best to approach
	treatment options, including optimal use of recently approved drugs
	(maraviroc, raltegravir, and etravirine) in treatment-experienced
	patients. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: A 14-member panel with
	expertise in HIV research and clinical care was appointed. Data published
	or presented at selected scientific conferences since the last panel
	report (August 2006) through June 2008 were identified. DATA EXTRACTION
	AND SYNTHESIS: Data that changed the previous guidelines were reviewed
	by the panel (according to section). Guidelines were drafted by section
	writing committees and were then reviewed and edited by the entire
	panel. Recommendations were made by panel consensus. CONCLUSIONS:
	New data and considerations support initiating therapy before CD4
	cell count declines to less than 350/microL. In patients with 350
	CD4 cells/microL or more, the decision to begin therapy should be
	individualized based on the presence of comorbidities, risk factors
	for progression to AIDS and non-AIDS diseases, and patient readiness
	for treatment. In addition to the prior recommendation that a high
	plasma viral load (eg, >100,000 copies/mL) and rapidly declining
	CD4 cell count (>100/microL per year) should prompt treatment initiation,
	active hepatitis B or C virus coinfection, cardiovascular disease
	risk, and HIV-associated nephropathy increasingly prompt earlier
	therapy. The initial regimen must be individualized, particularly
	in the presence of comorbid conditions, but usually will include
	efavirenz or a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor plus 2 nucleoside
	reverse transcriptase inhibitors (tenofovir/emtricitabine or abacavir/lamivudine).
	Treatment failure should be identified and managed promptly, with
	the goal of therapy, even in heavily pretreated patients, being an
	HIV-1 RNA level below assay detection limits.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of adding a protease inhibitor
	to two nucleoside analogues to treat human immunodeficiency virus
	type 1 (HIV-1) infection are not clear. We compared treatment with
	the protease inhibitor indinavir in addition to zidovudine and lamivudine
	with treatment with the two nucleosides alone in HIV-infected adults
	previously treated with zidovudine. METHODS: A total of 1156 patients
	not previously treated with lamivudine or protease inhibitors were
	stratified according to CD4 cell count (50 or fewer vs. 51 to 200
	cells per cubic millimeter) and randomly assigned to one of two daily
	regimens: 600 mg of zidovudine (or stavudine) and 300 mg of lamivudine,
	or that regimen with 2400 mg of indinavir. The primary end point
	was the time to the development of the acquired immunodeficiency
	syndrome (AIDS) or death. RESULTS: The proportion of patients whose
	disease progressed to AIDS or death was lower with indinavir, zidovudine,
	and lamivudine (6 percent) than with zidovudine and lamivudine alone
	(11 percent; estimated hazard ratio, 0.50; 95 percent confidence
	interval, 0.33 to 0.76; P=0.001). Mortality in the two groups was
	1.4 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively (estimated hazard ratio,
	0.43; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.19 to 0.99; P=0.04). The
	effects of treatment were similar in both CD4 cell strata. The responses
	of CD4 cells and plasma HIV-1 RNA paralleled the clinical results.
	CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with indinavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine
	as compared with zidovudine and lamivudine alone significantly slows
	the progression of HIV-1 disease in patients with 200 CD4 cells or
	fewer per cubic millimeter and prior exposure to zidovudine.},

	infection were estimated for HIV-1-serodiscordant heterosexual couples
	in Rakai, Uganda, by use of a robust probabilistic framework. RESULTS:
	Primary infection and late-stage infection were estimated to be 26

	High infectiousness during primary infection was estimated to last

	19 months and 10 months before death. CONCLUSIONS: Primary and late-stage
	HIV-1 infection are more infectious than previously estimated, but
	for shorter periods. In a homogeneous population, the asymptomatic
	stage of infection will typically contribute more to the net transmission
	of HIV-1 over the lifetime of an infected individual, because of

	Methods.	We analyzed data from a prospective study of African HIV-1?serodiscordant couples. We assessed transmissions for linkage within the study partnership, based on HIV-1 sequencing. The primary exposure measure was the HIV-1?seropositive partners? reports of number of sex acts and condom use with their study partner.
	Results. Of 3297 couples experiencing 86 linked HIV-1 transmissions, the unadjusted per-act risks of unprotected male-to-female (MTF) and female-to-male (FTM) transmission were 0.0019 (95% confidence interval [CI], .0010?.0037) and 0.0010 (95% CI, .00060?.0017), respectively. After adjusting for plasma HIV-1 RNA of the HIV-1?infected partner and herpes simplex virus type 2 serostatus and age of the HIV-1?uninfected partner, we calculated the relative risk (RR) for MTF versus FTM transmission to be 1.03 (P 5 .93). Each log10 increase in plasma HIV-1 RNA increased the per-act risk of transmission by 2.9-fold (95% CI, 2.2?3.8). Self-reported condom use reduced the per-act risk by 78% (RR 5 0.22 [95% CI, .11?.42]).
	Conclusions.	Modifiable risk factors for HIV-1 transmission were plasma HIV-1 RNA level and condom use, and, in HIV-1?uninfected partners, herpes simplex virus 2 infection, genital ulcers, Trichomonas vaginalis, vaginitis or cervicitis, and male circumcision.},

	004 trial assessed the effectiveness and safety of a 1\% vaginal
	gel formulation of tenofovir, a nucleotide reverse transcriptase
	inhibitor, for the prevention of HIV acquisition in women. A double-blind,
	randomized controlled trial was conducted comparing tenofovir gel
	(n = 445 women) with placebo gel (n = 444 women) in sexually active,
	HIV-uninfected 18- to 40-year-old women in urban and rural KwaZulu-Natal,
	South Africa. HIV serostatus, safety, sexual behavior, and gel and
	condom use were assessed at monthly follow-up visits for 30 months.
	HIV incidence in the tenofovir gel arm was 5.6 per 100 women-years
	(person time of study observation) (38 out of 680.6 women-years)
	compared with 9.1 per 100 women-years (60 out of 660.7 women-years)
	in the placebo gel arm (incidence rate ratio = 0.61; P = 0.017).
	In high adherers (gel adherence > 80\%), HIV incidence was 54\% lower
	(P = 0.025) in the tenofovir gel arm. In intermediate adherers (gel
	adherence 50 to 80\%) and low adherers (gel adherence < 50\%), the
	HIV incidence reduction was 38 and 28\%, respectively. Tenofovir
	gel reduced HIV acquisition by an estimated 39\% overall, and by
	54\% in women with high gel adherence. No increase in the overall
	adverse event rates was observed. There were no changes in viral
	load and no tenofovir resistance in HIV seroconverters. Tenofovir
	gel could potentially fill an important HIV prevention gap, especially

	strong influence on transmission dynamics: (a) increased transmission
	probabilities and (b) increased transmission potential of partners
	infected during this period. Most attention has been focused on the
	first factor because it fits the way we usually think about risk
	factors affecting individuals. The second factor acts not on individuals,
	but across chains of transmission. It is missed by models with constant
	partnership formation rates over an individual's life or with random
	mixing. It cannot be assessed from available data collected from
	individuals. Its assessment requires data from both individuals in
	a partnership. We demonstrate that this second effect can be so strong
	that early infection can dominate transmission dynamics even when
	transmission probabilities are only modestly increased. This second
	effect is not directly parameterized in our models but arises from
	two realistic types of temporal variation in partnership formation:
	(a) Partnership formation rates vary by age with preferential partnership
	formation in one's own age group, and (b) individuals of any age
	can experience transient periods of high-risk partnership formation.
	In a model with only the age-related effect, early infection is observed
	to dominate transmission dynamics when 20\% of transmissible virus
	is allocated to the first 6 weeks of infection, 7\% to middle infection,
	and 73\% to late infection. This domination occurs both early in
	the course of an epidemic and later when endemic infection levels
	have been reached. When the second effect is added, early infection
	is seen to dominate transmission in a model allocating 10\% of transmissible
	virus to the first 6 months, 40\% to middle infection, and 50\% to
	late infection. In this model, transmission probabilities during
	early infection are only 4.17 times those of middle infection and
	half those of late-stage infection.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the feasibility, effectiveness, adherence, toxicity
	and viral resistance in an African government HAART initiative. METHODS:
	A prospective observational cohort study started in Dakar in August
	1998. Initial treatment consisted of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase
	inhibitors and one protease inhibitor. The patients attended monthly
	medical examinations. Plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4 cell counts were determined
	at baseline and every 6 months. Intention-to-treat analyses were
	performed. RESULTS: Fifty-eight treatment-naive patients, mostly
	infected by HIV-1 strain CRF02-AG, were enrolled. Most were at an
	advanced stage of HIV disease (86.2\% had AIDS). Adherence was good
	in 87.9\% of patients and treatment was effective in most of them.
	Thus, HIV-1 RNA was undetectable in 79.6, 71.2, 51.4 and 59.3\% of
	patients at months 1, 6, 12 and 18, respectively and the median viral
	load reduction was approximately 2.5 log10 copies/ml. The CD4 cell
	count rose by a median of 82, 147 and 180 x 106 cells/l at months
	6, 12 and 18, respectively. At the same time points, the cumulative
	probability of remaining alive or free of new AIDS-defining events
	was 94.8, 85.0 and 82.3\%. Most adverse effects (80.8\%) were mild
	or moderate and only two cases of drug resistance occurred. CONCLUSION:
	This study shows that HAART is feasible and well tolerated in African
	patients. Clinical and biological results were comparable to those
	seen in western cohorts, despite differences in the HIV-1 subtype
	distribution and an advanced disease stage when the treatment was
	initiated. Contrary to other recent studies in Africa, viral resistance
	rarely emerged.},

	25\%). OBJECTIVE: We estimated the relative contribution of these
	two groups in sexually transmitting new HIV infections to at-risk
	(HIV-negative or unknown serostatus) partners in the USA. METHODS:
	The parameters in the estimation included: number of people aware
	and unaware they are infected with HIV; 33\% of the aware group are
	at low risk of transmitting HIV because of low/undetectable viral
	load; 57\% relative reduction in the prevalence of unprotected anal
	and vaginal intercourse (UAV) with at-risk partners in persons aware
	(compared to unaware) they have HIV; and assumed differences in the
	average number of at-risk UAV partners in each awareness group (ranging
	from equal to twice as many in the unaware group). RESULTS: The proportion
	of sexually transmitted HIV from the HIV-positive unaware group was
	estimated to range from 0.54 (assuming no difference in average number
	of at-risk UAV partners between groups) to 0.70 (assuming twice as
	many at-risk UAV partners in the unaware group). Using the lower
	bounds, the transmission rate from the unaware group was 3.5 times
	that of the aware group after adjusting for population size differences
	between groups. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the HIV/AIDS
	epidemic can be lessened substantially by increasing the number of
	HIV-positive persons who are aware of their status.},

	has been shown to be effective in preventing HIV acquisition. Early-phase
	PrEP studies have established safety in humans. Currently, more than
	20,000 men and women will soon be enrolled in studies of oral or
	topical chemoprophylaxis, testing a variety of drug delivery methods
	including tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) gel applied vaginally
	or rectally, as well as oral PrEP using TDF by itself or coformulated
	with emtricitabine (FTC). The largest global PrEP trial in men who

	chemoprophylaxis can decrease HIV incidence in this population. Although
	TDF/FTC PrEP was generally well tolerated, side effects such as nausea,
	as well as mild and reversible renal abnormalities were increased
	among the men who received active medication, suggesting that PrEP
	users will need ongoing PrEP clinical monitoring. The prophylactic
	benefits of TDF/FTC were substantially attenuated by nonadherence,
	indicating that effective PrEP implementation programs will need
	to focus on this behavioral variable, in addition to safer sex counseling.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine shows promise
	as HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). We sought to forecast clinical,
	epidemiologic, and economic outcomes of PrEP, taking into account
	uncertainties regarding efficacy, the risks of developing drug resistance
	and toxicity, behavioral disinhibition, and drug costs. METHODS:
	We adapted a computer simulation of HIV acquisition, detection, and
	care to model PrEP among men who have sex with men and are at high
	risk of HIV infection (i.e., 1.6\% mean annual incidence of HIV infection)
	in the United States. Base-case assumptions included 50\% PrEP efficacy
	and monthly tenofovir-emtricitabine costs of $753. We used sensitivity
	analyses to examine the stability of results and to identify critical
	input parameters. RESULTS: In a cohort with a mean age of 34 years,
	PrEP reduced lifetime HIV infection risk from 44\% to 25\% and increased
	mean life expectancy from 39.9 to 40.7 years (21.7 to 22.2 discounted
	quality-adjusted life-years). Discounted mean lifetime treatment
	costs increased from $81,100 to $232,700 per person, indicating an
	incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $298,000 per quality-adjusted
	life-year gained. Markedly larger reductions in lifetime infection
	risk (from 44\% to 6\%) were observed with the assumption of greater
	(90\%) PrEP efficacy. More-favorable incremental cost-effectiveness
	ratios were obtained by targeting younger populations with a higher
	incidence of infection and by improvements in the efficacy and cost
	of PrEP. CONCLUSIONS: PrEP could substantially reduce the incidence
	of HIV transmission in populations at high risk of HIV infection
	in the United States. Although it is unlikely to confer sufficient
	benefits to justify the current costs of tenofovir-emtricitabine,
	price reductions and/or increases in efficacy could make PrEP a cost-effective
	option in younger populations or populations at higher risk of infection.
	Given recent disappointments in HIV infection prevention and vaccine
	development, additional study of PrEP-based HIV prevention is warranted.},

	of HIV-1 drug resistance for patients starting antiretroviral therapy
	(ART) with three or four drug regimens in routine clinical practice.
	METHODS: We analysed a large cohort study of patients seen in one
	of six large HIV clinics in and around London, UK. The focus of this
	analysis was on patients who started ART with two nucleosides plus
	either a single protease inhibitor (PI), a PI with ritonavir, abacavir
	or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). RESULTS:
	4306 patients were followed; 1436 (33\%) started with a single PI,
	279 (6\%) with a PI plus ritonavir, 156 (4\%) with triple nucleosides
	and 2435 (57\%) with an NNRTI. The overall cumulative risk of viral
	load failure was 38\% by 6 years. Risk of > or =1 major IAS-USA mutation
	was 27\% by 6 years; risk of mutations from at least two of the three
	main drug classes was 20\% over the same period. These are lower
	limit estimates as test results were not available for many with
	viral load failure. Risk of PI mutations being detected in people
	who started ART with regimens containing a PI with ritonavir was
	significantly lower than the risk of NNRTI mutations being detected
	in those starting with NNRTI-containing regimens (relative hazard
	0.3195\% CI 0.15-0.61; p = 0.0008). CONCLUSION: In routine practice,
	rates of viral load failure and of resistance detection in patients
	who started ART with three or four drugs are appreciable.},

	relation to other risk factors for the heterosexual transmission
	of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In a community-based
	study of 15,127 persons in a rural district of Uganda, we identified
	415 couples in which one partner was HIV-1-positive and one was initially
	HIV-1-negative and followed them prospectively for up to 30 months.
	The incidence of HIV-1 infection per 100 person-years among the initially
	seronegative partners was examined in relation to behavioral and
	biologic variables. RESULTS: The male partner was HIV-1-positive
	in 228 couples, and the female partner was HIV-1-positive in 187
	couples. Ninety of the 415 initially HIV-1-negative partners seroconverted
	(incidence, 11.8 per 100 person-years). The rate of male-to-female
	transmission was not significantly different from the rate of female-to-male
	transmission (12.0 per 100 person-years vs. 11.6 per 100 person-years).
	The incidence of seroconversion was highest among the partners who
	were 15 to 19 years of age (15.3 per 100 person-years). The incidence
	was 16.7 per 100 person-years among 137 uncircumcised male partners,
	whereas there were no seroconversions among the 50 circumcised male
	partners (P<0.001). The mean serum HIV-1 RNA level was significantly
	higher among HIV-1-positive subjects whose partners seroconverted
	than among those whose partners did not seroconvert (90,254 copies
	per milliliter vs. 38,029 copies per milliliter, P=0.01). There were
	no instances of transmission among the 51 subjects with serum HIV-1
	RNA levels of less than 1500 copies per milliliter; there was a significant
	dose-response relation of increased transmission with increasing
	viral load. In multivariate analyses of log-transformed HIV-1 RNA
	levels, each log increment in the viral load was associated with
	a rate ratio of 2.45 for seroconversion (95 percent confidence interval,
	1.85 to 3.26). CONCLUSIONS: The viral load is the chief predictor
	of the risk of heterosexual transmission of HIV-1, and transmission
	is rare among persons with levels of less than 1500 copies of HIV-1
	RNA per milliliter.},

	protease inhibitor (PI)-sparing, three-drug highly active antiretroviral
	therapy (HAART) in HIV- 1-infected, treatment-naive patients with
	high and low baseline viral loads. METHOD: A composite analysis was
	performed of clinical studies including the NNRTI nevirapine that
	were presented at international conferences between 1998 and October
	2000. In all of the studies, nevirapine was administered in combination
	with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). For
	a study to be included in the analysis, more than 25\% of participants
	must have had baseline viral loads >100,000 copies/mL, and more than
	25\% of participants must have had viral loads <100,000 copies/mL.
	RESULTS: After 6 months, 139 of 156 (89\%) and 82 of 99 (83\% ) patients
	in the low and high baseline viral load groups, respectively, had
	on-treatment viral loads <200 to 500 copies/mL (depending on assay
	used). After 12 months, 95 of 124 patients (77\%) with lower baseline
	viral loads and 63 of 76 patients (83\%) with high baseline viral
	loads had on-treatment viral loads below the limit of quantification.
	CONCLUSION: Baseline viral load does not affect virologic outcome

	introduced the term "core" initially to loosely describe the collection

	the early epidemic during the exponential growth phase and focus
	on the core group because most infected people were infected by people
	in the core. We argue that in the early outbreak phase of an epidemic,
	there is an identity, which we call the "outbreak equation." It relates
	three ratios that describe the core men versus the core women, namely,
	the ratio E of numbers of all core men to all core women, the ratio
	C of numbers of infected core men to core women, and the ratio M
	of the infectiousness of a typical core man to that of a typical
	core woman. Then the relationship between the ratios is E=MC(2) in
	the early outbreak phase. We investigate two very different scenarios,
	one in which there are two times as many core men as core women (E=2)
	and the other in which core men equal core women (E=1). In the first
	case, the HIV epidemic grows at a much faster rate. We conclude that
	if the female core group was larger, that is, if more women in the
	total population were promiscuous (or if fewer men were promiscuous)
	then the HIV epidemic would grow more slowly.},

	model and defining a new quantity-the fitness ratio-we show that
	disease-modifying vaccines that provide only a low degree of protection

	high probability of making the epidemic worse. However, we show that
	if disease-modifying vaccines cause a 1.5 log(10) reduction in viral
	load (or greater) then perversity cannot occur (assuming risk behaviour
	does not increase). Finally, we determine threshold surfaces for
	risk behaviour change that determine the boundary between beneficial
	and perverse outcomes; the threshold surfaces are determined by the
	fitness ratio, the proportion of the population that are "successfully
	vaccinated", and the degree of change of risk behaviour in unvaccinated
	infected individuals. We discuss the implications of our results

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Botswana antiretroviral program began in 2002 and
	currently treats 42,000 patients, with a goal of treating 85,000
	by 2009. The World Health Organization (WHO) has begun to implement
	a surveillance system for detecting transmitted resistance that exceeds
	a threshold of 5\%. However, the WHO has not determined when this
	threshold will be reached. Here we model the Botswana government's
	treatment plan and predict, to 2009, the likely stochastic evolution
	of transmitted resistance. METHODS: We developed a model of the stochastic
	evolution of drug-resistant strains and formulated a birth-death
	Master equation. We analyzed this equation to obtain an analytical
	solution of the probabilistic evolutionary trajectory for transmitted
	resistance, and used treatment and demographic data from Botswana.
	We determined the temporal dynamics of transmitted resistance as
	a function of: (i) the transmissibility (i.e., fitness) of the drug-resistant
	strains that may evolve and (ii) the rate of acquired resistance.
	RESULTS: Transmitted resistance in Botswana will be unlikely to exceed
	the WHO's threshold by 2009 even if the rate of acquired resistance
	is high and the strains that evolve are half as fit as the wild-type
	strains. However, we also found that transmission of drug-resistant
	strains in Botswana could increase to approximately 15\% by 2009
	if the drug-resistant strains that evolve are as fit as the wild-type
	strains. CONCLUSIONS: Transmitted resistance will only be detected
	by the WHO (by 2009) if the strains that evolve are extremely fit
	and acquired resistance is high. Initially after a treatment program
	is begun a threshold lower than 5\% should be used; and we advise
	that predictions should be made before setting a threshold. Our results
	indicate that it may be several years before the WHO's surveillance
	system is likely to detect transmitted resistance in other resource-poor
	countries that have significantly less ambitious treatment programs
	than Botswana.},

	transmission in different HIV epidemics. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
	We used a mathematical model that distinguishes the general population,
	sex workers and their clients. PrEP scenarios varying in effectiveness,
	coverage and target group were modeled in the epidemiological settings
	of Botswana, Nyanza Province in Kenya, and Southern India. We also
	studied the effect of condom addition or condom substitution during
	PrEP use. Main outcome was number of HIV infections averted over
	ten years of PrEP use. PrEP strategies with high effectiveness and
	high coverage can have a substantial impact in African settings.
	In Southern India, by contrast, the number of averted HIV infections
	in different PrEP scenarios would be much lower. The impact of PrEP
	may be strongly diminished or even reversed by behavioral disinhibition,
	especially in scenarios with low coverage and low effectiveness.
	However, additional condom use during low coverage and low effective
	PrEP doubled the amount of averted HIV infections. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
	The public health impact of PrEP can be substantial. However, this
	impact may be diminished, or even reversed, by changes in risk behavior.
	Implementation of PrEP strategies should therefore come on top of
	current condom campaigns, not as a substitution.},

  abstract = {Recently Granich et al. at theWorld Health Organization (WHO) concluded,
	using mathematical modeling, that HIV epidemics
	
	could be eliminated within a decade. They assumed all individuals
	would be tested annually and every infected individual
	
	(regardless of stage of infection) would be put on treatment. Based
	on this modeling study the WHO is considering using
	
	universal testing and treatment as an HIV elimination strategy. Here
	we examine the study by Granich et al. and assess its
	
	validity. We present new analyses of their model by varying assumptions
	and parameter values. We find that under certain
	
	very optimistic assumptions HIV elimination would be (theoretically)
	possible, but it would take at least 70 years. To obtain
	
	this result we assumed 65% of symptomatic and 20% of asymptomatic
	individuals would be treated per year; ARVs would
	
	reduce infectivity of treated individuals a hundred fold, and only
	5% of symptomatic individuals would give up treatment per
	
	year. Even under optimistic assumptions we find elimination to be
	unlikely. For example, we show if 65% of symptomatic
	
	individuals are treated per year and treated individuals are completely
	noninfectious, HIV will remain endemic with a prevalence
	
	of 34% and an incidence of 2% per year. We conclude that the model
	developed by Granich et al., when used with realistic
	
	parameter values, does not show HIV elimination is possible. However
	our modeling results show treatment could act as an
	
	effective prevention tool and significantly reduce transmission, even
	if only symptomatic individuals receive ARVs. Treatment
	
	should first, and foremost, be used for therapeutic purposes. Hence,
	we recommend when resources are limited - targeting
	
	those in need of treatment. Such a strategy would be ethical, feasible
	and epidemiologically sound. We advise that models
	
	used as health policy tools should be carefully evaluated and their

	male circumcision and reduced risk of HIV infection in female partners.
	We assessed whether circumcision in HIV-infected men would reduce
	transmission of the virus to female sexual partners. METHODS: 922
	uncircumcised, HIV-infected, asymptomatic men aged 15-49 years with
	CD4-cell counts 350 cells per microL or more were enrolled in this
	unblinded, randomised controlled trial in Rakai District, Uganda.
	Men were randomly assigned by computer-generated randomisation sequence
	to receive immediate circumcision (intervention; n=474) or circumcision
	delayed for 24 months (control; n=448). HIV-uninfected female partners
	of the randomised men were concurrently enrolled (intervention, n=93;
	control, n=70) and followed up at 6, 12, and 24 months, to assess
	HIV acquisition by male treatment assignment (primary outcome). A
	modified intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, which included all concurrently
	enrolled couples in which the female partner had at least one follow-up
	visit over 24 months, assessed female HIV acquisition by use of survival
	analysis and Cox proportional hazards modelling. This trial is registered
	with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00124878. FINDINGS: The trial
	was stopped early because of futility. 92 couples in the intervention
	group and 67 couples in the control group were included in the modified
	ITT analysis. 17 (18\%) women in the intervention group and eight
	(12\%) women in the control group acquired HIV during follow-up (p=0.36).
	Cumulative probabilities of female HIV infection at 24 months were

  abstract = {The availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART),
	that suppresses replication of the human immunodeficiency virus type
	1 (HIV-1), has dramatically improved the prognosis of HIV-infected
	patients. In populations with access to HAART, the course of the
	infection has changed from an inevitably fatal disease, characterized
	by a high incidence of opportunistic infections, into a potentially-treatable
	chronic condition. Unfortunately, HAART does not durably suppress
	HIV replication in 20-50\% of treatment-naive patients and in up
	to 50-70\% of treatment-experienced patients. In the majority of
	patients with viral rebound, drug-resistance-related mutations are

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Male circumcision (circumcision) reduces
	HIV incidence in men by 50-60\%. The United Nations Joint Programme
	on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) recommends the provision of safe circumcision
	services in countries with high HIV and low circumcision prevalence,
	prioritizing 12-30 years old HIV-uninfected men. We explore how the
	population-level impact of circumcision varies by target age group,
	coverage, time-to-scale-up, level of risk compensation and circumcision
	of HIV infected men. DESIGN AND METHODS: An individual-based model
	was fitted to the characteristics of a typical high-HIV-prevalence
	population in sub-Saharan Africa and three scenarios of individual-level
	impact corresponding to the central and the 95\% confidence level
	estimates from the Kenyan circumcision trial. The simulated intervention
	increased the prevalence of circumcision from 25 to 75\% over 5 years
	in targeted age groups. The impact and cost-effectiveness of the
	intervention were calculated over 2-50 years. Future costs and effects
	were discounted and compared with the present value of lifetime HIV
	treatment costs (US$ 4043). RESULTS: Initially, targeting men older
	than the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS recommended age
	group may be the most cost-effective strategy, but targeting any
	adult age group will be cost-saving. Substantial risk compensation
	could negate impact, particularly if already circumcised men compensate.
	If circumcision prevalence in HIV uninfected men increases less because
	HIV-infected men are also circumcised, this will reduce impact in
	men but would have little effect on population-level impact in women.
	CONCLUSION: Circumcision is a cost-saving intervention in a wide
	range of scenarios of HIV and initial circumcision prevalence but
	the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS/WHO recommended target
	age group should be widened to include older HIV-uninfected men and
	counselling should be targeted at both newly and already circumcised
	men to minimize risk compensation. To maximize infections-averted,
	circumcision must be scaled up rapidly while maintaining quality.},

	circumcision (MC) reduces sexual transmission of HIV from women to
	men by 60\% (32\%-76\%; 95\% CI) offering an intervention of proven
	efficacy for reducing the sexual spread of HIV. We explore the implications
	of this finding for the promotion of MC as a public health intervention
	to control HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using
	dynamical simulation models we consider the impact of MC on the relative
	prevalence of HIV in men and women and in circumcised and uncircumcised
	men. Using country level data on HIV prevalence and MC, we estimate
	the impact of increasing MC coverage on HIV incidence, HIV prevalence,
	and HIV-related deaths over the next ten, twenty, and thirty years
	in sub-Saharan Africa. Assuming that full coverage of MC is achieved
	over the next ten years, we consider three scenarios in which the
	reduction in transmission is given by the best estimate and the upper
	and lower 95\% confidence limits of the reduction in transmission
	observed in the RCT. MC could avert 2.0 (1.1-3.8) million new HIV
	infections and 0.3 (0.1-0.5) million deaths over the next ten years
	in sub-Saharan Africa. In the ten years after that, it could avert
	a further 3.7 (1.9-7.5) million new HIV infections and 2.7 (1.5-5.3)
	million deaths, with about one quarter of all the incident cases
	prevented and the deaths averted occurring in South Africa. We show
	that a) MC will increase the proportion of infected people who are
	women from about 52\% to 58\%; b) where there is homogenous mixing
	but not all men are circumcised, the prevalence of infection in circumcised
	men is likely to be about 80\% of that in uncircumcised men; c) MC
	is equivalent to an intervention, such as a vaccine or increased
	condom use, that reduces transmission in both directions by 37\%.
	CONCLUSIONS: This analysis is based on the result of just one RCT,
	but if the results of that trial are confirmed we suggest that MC
	could substantially reduce the burden of HIV in Africa, especially
	in southern Africa where the prevalence of MC is low and the prevalence
	of HIV is high. While the protective benefit to HIV-negative men
	will be immediate, the full impact of MC on HIV-related illness and
	death will only be apparent in ten to twenty years.},

	are one of the most promising biomedical interventions. Clinical
	trials of second-generation microbicides have begun; if shown to
	be effective, they could be licensed within 5-10 years. Because these
	microbicides contain antiretrovirals (ARVs), they could be highly
	effective. However, there is concern that, if used by HIV-positive
	women, ARV resistance may evolve. By analyzing a mathematical model,
	we find that adherence could have both beneficial and detrimental
	effects on trial outcomes. Most importantly, we show that planned
	trial designs could mask resistance risks and therefore enable high-risk
	microbicides to pass clinical testing. We then parameterize a transmission
	model using epidemiological, clinical, and behavioral data to predict
	the consequences of wide-scale usage of high-risk microbicides in
	a heterosexual population. Surprisingly, we show that reducing a
	participant's risk of resistance during a trial could lead to unexpectedly
	high rates of resistance afterward when microbicides are used in
	public health interventions. We also find that, paradoxically, although
	microbicides will be used by women to protect themselves against
	infection, they could provide greater benefit to men. More infections
	in men than in women will be prevented if there is a high probability
	that ARVs are systemically absorbed, microbicides are less than approximately
	50\% effective, and/or adherence is less than approximately 60\%.
	Men will always benefit more than women in terms of infections prevented
	per resistant case; but this advantage decreases as the relative
	fitness of drug-resistant strains increases. Interventions that use
	ARV-based microbicides could have surprising consequences.},

  abstract = {Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is becoming available in South Africa.
	Demand will exceed supply; thus, difficult decisions will have to
	be made in allocating ART. The majority of those treated for HIV
	are likely to be in cities, because health infrastructure and personnel
	are concentrated in urban centers. We predict the epidemiological
	impact of drug allocation strategies (DAS) by using a spatially explicit
	model that links urban and rural epidemics. We parameterize our model
	by using data from the KwaZulu-Natal province in South Africa. We
	model the South African government's treatment plan from 2004-2008,
	and we predict the consequences of one DAS that allocates drugs only
	to Durban and of two DAS that allocate drugs to both urban and rural
	areas. All three strategies would treat 500,000 people by 2008. Not
	surprisingly, the Durban-only DAS would prevent the greatest number
	of infections (an additional 15,000 infections by 2008). However,
	it may have been expected that this DAS would generate the highest
	levels of transmitted resistance, because it concentrates ART in
	one location. Paradoxically, we found that this DAS would generate
	the lowest levels of transmitted resistance. Concentrating treatment
	in Durban would also avert the greatest number of AIDS-related deaths.
	We discuss the difference between using the principle of treatment
	equity versus using the principle of utilitarianism/efficiency to
	allocate ART. Decisions about allocating scarce drugs should consider
	treatment equity as well as epidemiological consequences. Notably,
	a Durban-only DAS would lead to new disparities in healthcare between
	urban and rural areas in KwaZulu-Natal.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the contribution of primary or acute HIV infection
	to the transmission of HIV among homosexual men in Amsterdam and
	to investigate how the initiation of treatment during primary HIV
	infection (PHI) can affect the incidence of HIV infection. METHODS:
	A mathematical model describing HIV transmission among homosexual
	men was developed. In the model, men are involved in both steady
	and casual partnerships. Infectivity is higher during PHI than during
	chronic HIV infection. Highly active antiretroviral therapy reduces
	infectivity and increases the time to the development of AIDS. Its
	effect is enhanced if treatment is initiated during PHI. HIV incidence
	and the fraction of transmission attributed to PHI were calculated
	for different levels of treatment efficacy. RESULTS: Primary infections
	account for 35\% of HIV transmissions from casual partners and 6\%
	of transmissions from steady partners. Among all new infections,
	only 11\% occurs during PHI. Therefore, the effect of treatment during
	PHI on the incidence of HIV is limited. However, in a community with
	higher risky behaviour among casual partners, the fraction of transmission
	attributed to PHI increases to 25\%. CONCLUSION: Primary infections
	play a more important role in transmission from casual partners than
	in transmission from steady partners. Therefore, in communities in
	which steady partners account for the majority of new infections
	and the epidemic is at an advanced phase, the contribution of PHI
	to the transmission of HIV is rather small and the effect of early
	treatment on the incidence of HIV is limited.},

	exposure.},
  journal = {Cochrane Database Syst Rev},
  year = {2007},
  pages = {CD002835},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Populations such as healthcare workers (HCWs), injection
	drug users (IDUs), and people engaging in unprotected sex are all
	at risk of being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
	Animal models show that after initial exposure, HIV replicates within
	dendritic cells of the skin and mucosa before spreading through lymphatic
	vessels and developing into a systemic infection (CDC 2001). This
	delay in systemic spread leaves a "window of opportunity" for post-exposure
	prophylaxis (PEP) using antiretroviral drugs designed to block replication
	of HIV (CDC 2001). PEP aims to inhibit the replication of the initial
	inoculum of virus and thereby prevent establishment of chronic HIV
	infection. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of antiretroviral
	PEP post-occupational exposure to HIV. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane
	Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE,
	AIDSearch, and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness
	were searched from 1985 to January 2005 to identify controlled trials.
	There were no language restrictions. Because no controlled clinical
	trials were retrieved, the search was repeated on 31 May 2005 in
	MEDLINE, AIDSearch and EMBASE using a search strategy to identify
	analytic observational studies. Handsearches of the reference lists
	of all pertinent reviews and studies found were also undertaken.
	Experts in the field of HIV prevention were contacted. SELECTION
	CRITERIA: Types of studies: All controlled trials (including randomized
	clinical trials and controlled clinical trials). If no controlled
	trials were found, analytic studies (e.g. cohort and case-control
	studies) were considered. Descriptive studies (i.e. studies with
	no comparison groups) were excluded. Types of participants included:HCWs
	exposed to any known or potentially HIV contaminated product;anyone
	exposed to a needlestick contaminated by known or potentially HIV-infected
	blood or other bodily fluid in an occupational setting; andanyone
	exposed through the mucous membranes to an HIV-infected or potentially
	infected substance in occupational setting.Excluded: Sex workers
	(PEP post-sexual exposure is addressed in another Cochrane review
	(Mart?n 2005)). Types of interventions: Any intervention that administered
	single or combinations of antiretrovirals as PEP to people exposed
	to HIV through percutaneous injuries and/or occupational mucous membrane
	exposures when the HIV status of the source patient was positive
	or unknown. Studies comparing two types of PEP regimens were considered,
	as were studies comparing PEP with no intervention. Types of outcome
	measures:Incidence of HIV infection in those given PEP versus those
	given placebo or a different PEP regimen; Adherence to PEP; Complications
	of PEPTypes of outcome measures: Incidence of HIV infection in those
	given PEP versus those given placebo or a different PEP regimen;
	Adherence to PEP; Complications of PEP DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:
	Data concerning outcomes, details of the interventions, and other
	study characteristics were extracted by two independent authors (TY
	and JA) using a standardized data extraction form (Table 04). A third
	author (GK) resolved disagreements. The following information was
	gathered from each included study: location of study, date, publication
	status, demographics (e.g. age, gender, occupation, risk behavior,
	etc.) of participants/exposure modality, form of PEP used, duration
	of use, and outcomes. Odds ratios with a 95\% confidence interval
	(CI) were used as the measure of effect. A meta-analysis was performed
	for adverse events where two-drug regimens were compared with three-drug
	regimens. Due to overlap between Puro 2000 and Puro 2005, the former
	was not included in the combined analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Effect of
	PEP on HIV seroconversionNo randomized controlled trials were identified.
	Only one case-control study was included. HIV transmission was significantly
	associated with deep injury (OR 15, 95\% CI 6.0 to 41), visible blood
	on the device (OR 6.2, 95\% CI 2.2 to 21), procedures involving a
	needle placed in the source patient's blood vessel (OR 4.3, 95\%
	CI 1.7 to 12), and terminal illness in the source patient (OR 5.6,
	95\% CI 2.0 to 16). After controlling for these risk factors, no
	differences were detected in the rates at which cases and controls
	were offered post-exposure prophylaxis with zidovudine. However,
	cases had significantly lower odds of having taken zidovudine after
	exposure compared to controls (OR 0.19, 95\%CI 0.06 to 0.52). No
	studies were found that evaluated the effect of two or more antiretroviral
	drugs for occupational PEP. Adherence to and complications with PEPEight
	reports from observational comparative studies confirmed findings
	that adverse events were higher with a three-drug regimen, especially
	one containing indinavir. However, discontinuation rates were not
	significantly different. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The use of occupational
	PEP is based on limited direct evidence of effect. However, it is
	highly unlikely that a definitive placebo-controlled trial will ever
	be conducted, and, therefore, on the basis of results from a single
	case-control study, a four-week regimen of PEP should be initiated
	as soon as possible after exposure, depending on the risk of seroconversion.
	There is no direct evidence to support the use of multi-drug antiretroviral
	regimens following occupational exposure to HIV. However, due to
	the success of combination therapies in treating HIV-infected individuals,
	a combination of antiretroviral drugs should be used for PEP. Healthcare
	workers should be counseled about expected adverse events and the
	strategies for managing these. They should also be advised that PEP
	is not 100\% effective in preventing HIV seroconversion. A randomized
	controlled clinical trial is neither ethical nor practical. Due to
	the low risk of HIV seroconversion, a very large sample size would
	be required to have enough power to show an effect. More rigorous
	evaluation of adverse events, especially in the developing world,
	are required. Seeing that current practice is partly based on results
	from individual primary animal studies, we recommend a formal systematic
	review of all relevant animal studies.},
